Residential students could stay in their residence halls, but classrooms were to be closed and traveling to campus would be extremely difficult for non-residential students. Next, imagine you are charged with considering how you might turn that situation into one or more learning experience. "

"The Personal API Path: Steps Towards Nirvana
",2016,November,Presentation,https://openeducation2016.sched.com/event/7lnm/the-personal-api-path-steps-towards-nirvana?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no,Open Education,"Kin Lane, API Evangelist, has long been a traveler on the API path. Tom Woodward has newly come to it. Kin will explain API Nirvana, that it's more a journey than a destination, and Tom will explain the path and patterns of his early progress towards that destination. The use of APIs will range from the practical to the whimsical. The API path is, after all, what you make of it. 

While each person must walk their own API path, there is a direction to follow. All seekers must extinguish the fires of-
-Ignorance - not knowing where your content is or how it is governed
-Short-sightedness - not realizing how temporary so many things are
-Compartmentalization - not taking advantage of the connecteness of all things

Giving a nitrate-free duck and armagnac sausage to someone who wanted Oscar Mayer is recipe for unhappiness on both sides.

Recalibrate. Figure out who is never going to want anything but hot dogs. Give them hot dogs. Look at ways to elevate the palate of those who might want better down the road. Find sources of inspiration to keep your own palate growing alongside your skills"

Design thinking is a marketing ploy created by 3M to drive demand for sticky notes.

Waterfall Agile Scrum Standups only result in ad campaigns for bespoke beard oils.

The most interesting projects are full of unknowns. You can’t plan it all out. You don’t know how many hours it will take. You don’t know if you have all the skills necessary to make it work. Your memorandum of understanding will not be enough.

Fling yourself into the abyss with a mixture of fear and elation.

We’ll break down four major projects that evolved and grew in unpredictable ways. We’ll focus on ups, downs and dispositional positions that enabled organic success in an KPI-driven environment."
Small Tech for Higher Ed,2020,April,Presentation,https://oer20.oerconf.org/sessions/o-124/,OER 20,"The acronym SPLOT was coined by Brian Lamb (Levine, 2014) when working with Alan Levine to create tools that solved a number of issues seen in the LMS and ad-based web tools. While it’s (intentionally) difficult to pin down an exact definition (Splot.ca, 2019), the focus is on simple tools that protect student privacy while providing powerful opportunities for students to create and share media that directly align with learning objectives.

SPLOTs support and value open education while making it as easy as possible to post media in an appealing and accessible way."
It Could Be Beautiful: Aspirational vs Operational Learning Technology,2021,November,Presentation,http://jfinnell.colgate.domains/horizons/tom-woodward/,Colgate Horizons Series,"Faculty and students have increasingly complex and specific technology needs that A great deal of energy and attention has been focused on using technology to automatically grade quizzes, to “capture” lectures, to make the most massive MOOC . . . to McDonaldize education. There is another path. Technology can humanize. It can augment, extend, and empower. There is real transformative power for learners when they interact with well-crafted experiences and build with well-designed tools. The ability to make useful products, to unite the abstract and concrete, to enable fluid and interactive presentation of data towards new and deeper understandings – this is where technology starts to matter.
